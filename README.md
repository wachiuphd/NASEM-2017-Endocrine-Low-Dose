# NASEM-2017-Endocrine-Low-Dose

This archive repository contains R code, data and results for the report: National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. 2017. Application of Systematic Review Methods in an Overall Strategy for Evaluating Low-Dose Toxicity from Endocrine Active Chemicals. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. https://doi.org/10.17226/24758.
 
Note - these analyses were run in 2017, so slight differences may result if re-running these codes now due to version changes in the underlying R packages.

## Phthalates folder

Two R markdown files, with corresponding knitted Word files, for effects of phthalates in experimental animals:

* Phthalate animal-DEHP.Final.Rmd
* Phthalate animal-no strain grouping.Final.Rmd
* Phthalate_animal-DEHP.Final.docx
* Phthalate_animal-no_strain_grouping.Final.docx

Two R markdown files, with corresponding knitted Word files, for effects of phthalates on anogenital distance (AGD) from human epidemiologic studies:

* DEHP.AGD.epi.Final.Rmd
